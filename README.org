* Practicalli Doom Emacs Config

A personal configuration for Doom Emacs with a focus on creating a similar key binding and menu experience to that of Spacemacs, as [[https://jr0cket.co.uk/2015/08/spacemacs-first-impressions-from-an-emacs-driven-developer.html][Practicalli has used Spacemacs since 2015]].

Doom Emacs default key bindings have been changed significantly and further changes will be made as this project evolves.  Therefore this configuration is probably not directly applicable for those already comfortable with the Doom Emacs maintainers workflow (although there are quite a few commonalities).


** Rebound keys
The most noticalbe key bindings changed from the Doom Emacs defaults include:

~,~ is set to local leader and ~SPC~ remains the leader key

~SPC TAB~ jumps to previous buffer

~SPC l TAB~ jumps to previously selected workspace (layout in Spacemacs terms)

~SPC g s~ opens Magit status (rather than stage hunk at point)

~jj~ alternative key binding to pressing ~ESC~ key

** Added keys

~, ,~ close the commit message and create the commit (text-mode-map)

~, k~ cancel the commit message without commit (text-mode-map)


** Org-mode [1/2]
- [-] Pretty checkboxes [1/2]
  - [X] Added code from practicalli/spacemacs.d
  - [ ] Review why checkbox icons not being used
- [ ] Review org-mode key bindings
  - [ ]  ~, b d~ to add code blocks via babel demarcate


** Screencasts

~SPC t k~ to enable ~keycast-mode~ which shows key bindings and commands in the modeline as you type, exspecially useful for screencasts (or to learn what commands the key bindings are calling)
